INSTALL
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant libav-tools inkscape

Run tests
---------

    make test

Eclipse
-------

I can't understand why, but somehow I started this project using Eclipse.
You don't have to, but if you do want to, the .project and .classpath files
are there.  Do File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace to
get started.

Contributing
------------

As far as is practical, all code should be unit tested.
