INSTALL
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant libav-tools inkscape

Run tests
---------

    make test

IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

The main directory contains IntelliJ project files - the project should
compile and run out of the box - please contact us if not.

Eclipse
-------

There are Eclipse project files, so "File" -> "Import" ->
"Existing projects into workspace" should work.

Contributing
------------

As far as is practical, all code should be unit tested.
