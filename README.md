Rabbit Escape
=============

Rabbit Escape is a mobile game inspired by Lemmings and Pingus
in which you must rescue some rabbits from a hostile environment
by giving them special abilities.

Screenshots
-----------

So far, there is only the text interface, which looks like this:

    ################################
    # r                            #
    #rf                            #
    #ff                            #
    #f            b                #
    #     Q     /\z           #    #
    #  #     /######\/#\     ###   #
    #\ #\   /###########\   b###  O#
    ################################

Running
-------

To run the text interface, do:

    make run

At the moment, there is no interaction, but some aspects of the gameplay
can be seen in this view.  It is a bit like looking into the matrix, though.
