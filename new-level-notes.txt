Some new levels sent by Andy Buckle.

## new/level_01  No bunny left behind

Fun.  I used the same trick as level hard 16: slow the other 4 down with bridgers.  Is there some other trick?  I also managed to get them trapped in the top part with bridges (and release them with a digger), but to do that I still needed to use further bridges to slow them down.

## new/level_02  Prison break
Love how this looks.  Did it second time, but really enjoyed it.  Might be a tiny bit too wide, in terms of fitting easily on the screen?  Also, "Which order should you free them in?" ends a sentence with a preposition ;-)

## new/level_03  Tree climb
Again, really like the look of this.  Again, a bit wide for some screens?  Solved it first time, but really enjoyed it.  I wonder whether there's a way to save all 4?

## new/level_04  Rabbit hole descent
Looks intimidating at first glance (which is a good thing).  Solved it first time by saving rabbits that did the digging and losing the other two.  Not sure whether that was the intended solution.  Wondering whether I can save more.  Had quite a few tries and didn't get anywhere.  Could probably exploit the current fall-onto-exit bug (issue #8) but I want to get rid of that.

## new/level_05  (Andy didn't send me one with this number...?)


## new/level_06  Home sweet home
Nice looking.  I saved all 8 on the first attempt with just 3 bashers along the bottom, and 2 diggers at the top to get the top ones down.  Was another solution intended?

## new/level_07  London Bridge
Again, really nice looking!  Nice little puzzle.  Solved first time, but needed to do some counting first.  Can avoid use of basher by waiting for all rabbits to be out.  Might be possible to distract from the correct solution (bridging together) by offering alternative routes somehow?

## new/level_08  Saw
Intruiging at first glance.  Quite easy because there's only really one solution.  Different, though.  With 1 more bridger I reckon I could save 6.  [Rabbits don't move very pleasingly in this level - several graphic glitches are exposed.]

## new/level_09  Re-entry
Big, fun-looking.  Quite large for some screens.  Thought it was easy to save them all, but was fooled by the drop from the moon to the rocket being too far.  Was able to save 3 extremely easily by just digging and bashing inside the rocket.  Presumably the challenge is to save one of the ones in the moon.  Was able to save all 3 of them by using issue #8 (falling direct onto exit) but assume that is not the intended solution.  (I hope not, because I think that is a bug that should be fixed.)  Was able to save 5 by bridging from rocket towards moon, which I presume is the intended solution?
To get 3: Thought: 3, Skill:1
To get 4 without cheating: Thought: 8, Skill: 7


## new/level_10  Cups and bridges
Quite large for some screens, but again fun to look at.  Was quite stumped by this one.  Can bridge your way out of the top and kill your rabbits: probably should have more empty space at the top.  Took me a while to work out - really enjoyed it!  By some crazy coincidence, the 2 bridgers to get over the left-hand gap were exactly synchronised, so I saved 7, but could probably never do it again (could saving 7 be the last level in a very hard set?).  In theory, you could get 8 by doing this on both gaps.
